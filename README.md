📌 The idea of ​​this script is just to facilitate the search for ports 
on the local network to apply pivoting techniques. Given that, I took the 
opportunity to create another simple function to scan external networks! 
Nothing much hahaha, just for fun and enjoyment of what I like to do with python!
