# lps2pivot 🥷🏼

<h4>📌 lps2pivot is a simple script to find open ports on localhost and external hosts.
Created in python, this script aims my learning in python for pentesting.</h4>

<h4>📌 The idea of ​​this script is just to facilitate the search for ports 
on the local network to apply pivoting techniques. Given that, I took the 
opportunity to create another simple function to scan external networks! 
Nothing much hahaha, just for fun and enjoyment of what I like to do with python!</h4>
